GA Week 4 Assignment 

Part 1 - 2
Created View Controller, then added the Table and cell to it manually, 
then coded it with protocols. First started with array of strings and populated.
Then added via a function in the didViewLoad
Then added a delegate to the text field

Part 3 - 4
Created View controller and replicated the above, and changed the fields and 
added the extra text input and extra label into field. Note i could have kept
one label as List Cell, and put the key and value into a single string
but i choose to enter into different cells to practice.

Also for both sections i have contrained the fields with the UI so it should fit.

Part 5

Thought this could be done a simpler way but I have used the NSNotificationCenter
to access UIKeyboardWillShowNotification via the addObserver.

Thanks,
Paulo Tam
